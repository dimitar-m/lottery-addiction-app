    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examines the probabilities of winning in a 6/49 lottery, focusing on scenarios such as matching all six numbers, partial matches, and the impact of purchasing multiple tickets. The goal is to provide clear insights into the odds of success, helping users understand the improbability of jackpot wins and the likelihood of smaller prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I used mathematical combinatorics to calculate probabilities, analyzed historical occurrences of specific number combinations, and assessed how multiple ticket purchases affect winning chances. Additionally, I explored the odds of matching 2, 3, 4, or 5 numbers to highlight how these outcomes compare to hitting the jackpot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed that while the odds of winning the jackpot are extremely low (approximately **0.0000072%**), smaller matches are much more achievable, with probabilities of **13.24%** for matching 2 numbers and **1.77%** for matching 3 numbers. These findings offer a practical perspective on lottery probabilities, illustrating the steep odds of major wins while emphasizing the importance of setting realistic expectations when playing."

    "- The ticket must contain exactly six unique numbers.  \n",
    "- Each number must be between 1 and 49.  \n",
    "- If the input fails to meet these criteria, the function displays an error message and stops execution.  \n",

    "## Analysis of Checking Historical Occurrences of a Lottery Combination\n",
    "\n",
    "The `check_historical_occurence()` function determines whether a user's chosen lottery combination has ever been a winning set in the past. It takes two inputs:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`user_numbers`**: A Python list of six numbers (e.g., `[1, 6, 23, 24, 27, 39]`).  \n",
    "2. **`winning_numbers`**: A pandas Series of sets containing historical winning numbers (default: `raw_data['winning_numbers']`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert Input to Set**:  \n",
    "   - The user's combination is converted into a set using Python’s `set()` for easy comparison with historical winning combinations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Through Historical Data**:  \n",
    "   - The function checks for exact matches between the user's set and any historical winning combination.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count Matches**:  \n",
    "   - A counter keeps track of how many times the user’s combination has appeared as a winning set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Display Results**:  \n",
    "   - Outputs the number of times the combination occurred historically.  \n",
    "   - Shows the probability of winning in the next draw using the `one_ticket_probability()` function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Step Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This step provides users with valuable insights into the historical performance of their chosen numbers. By seeing if their combination has ever been lucky, users gain a deeper understanding of their chances. While this analysis highlights historical occurrences, it also reminds users of the actual probabilities for future draws, keeping their expectations grounded yet hopeful."

    "\n",
    "1. **Input**:  \n",
    "   - The function accepts a single input, `number`, which specifies how many numbers the user wants to match (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculation Steps**:  \n",
    "   - **Winning Combinations**: Calculates the number of ways to select `number` correct numbers from the 6 drawn.  \n",
    "   - **Remaining Combinations**: Determines the number of ways to choose the remaining numbers from the non-winning pool of 43 numbers.  \n",
    "   - **Successful Outcomes**: Multiplies the values for winning and remaining combinations to get the total number of successful outcomes.  \n",
    "   - **Probability**: Divides the total successful outcomes by the total possible combinations for the 6/49 lottery.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output**:  \n",
    "   - The function displays the probability as a percentage, rounded to eight decimal places, accompanied by a user-friendly message.  \n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzed the probabilities of winning a 6/49 lottery, focusing on various scenarios and outcomes. Starting with the odds of winning the jackpot with a single ticket, I expanded the analysis to include multi-ticket probabilities and the likelihood of matching fewer numbers, providing a comprehensive view of potential outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using detailed calculations and real-world examples, I quantified the rarity of winning combinations and contextualized these probabilities with historical data from the Canada Lottery. The results emphasize the astronomical odds of winning the jackpot while offering a structured framework for understanding lottery probabilities. This analysis not only illustrates the mathematics of chance but also provides practical insights into similar probability-based scenarios."
